[31m-Plugin installation is managed by using a binary on the node that extract plugin.zip files into the file system, this is done outside the active running of OpenSearch itself.  When OpenSearch starts it loads installed plugins into its JVM runtime.[m

 ## Versioning[m
 [m
[31m-OpenSearch systems have ways to deprecate unsupported patterns, feature, and APIs.[m

[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mPlugins for OpenSearch must match their version exactly the version of OpenSearch.  Older version numbers are not compatiable.[m
